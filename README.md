# Lob-Pong
Bouncing Off The Walls

This is a simple animated game using Java Graphics.
It is a diminutive version of the "Breakout" game by Atari in which the user can swivel their paddel left or right using the corresponding keys to prevent
the ping-pong ball from falling through. Each time the ball hits a surface, it bounces against it. The objective of the game is prevent the ball from falling
through for as long as possible. An object placed in the frame provides additional surfaces for the ball to bounce against. 

The program doesn't require any special configurations and can be run from any IDLE or the terminal.
